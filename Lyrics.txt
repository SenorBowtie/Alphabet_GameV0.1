Day after day I have stayed and listened to you 
unload your pain from all that you've been going through
And I hope things can change cause I care so much about you
but now I will pay for the self care I neglected to do

Please don't bet your life on me
Cause I don't know if I can take your heavy burden
Eroding every time I watch you fall apart
I want to help but I can't heal all that is broken
I think it's time for me to go and guard my heart
Guard my heart
Guard my heart
I think it's time for me to go

I can't pretend I have surplus energy to hand out to friends
when underneath I'm slowly bleeding
Oh, how I wish I had everything to give so you could smile again
We both forget I'm only human

Please don't bet your life on me
Cause I don't know if I can take your heavy burden
Eroding every time I watch you fall apart
I want to help but I can't heal all that is broken
I think it's time for me to go and guard my heart
Guard my heart
Guard my heart
I think it's time for me to go

I know you don't mean to hurt me
Right now any straw could break me
I've done all I can to make you feel better
but it's not enough

Cause I don't know if I can take your heavy burden
Eroding every time I watch you fall apart
I want to help but I can't heal all that is broken
I think it's time for me to go and guard my heart
I think it's time for me to go and guard my heart
I think it's time for me to go
Guard my heart
Guard my heart
Guard my heart
I think it's time for me to go and guard my heart
